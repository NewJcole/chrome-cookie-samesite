# Chrome extension:allow cookies without sameSite
## Support cross-site cookie carrying in Google Chrome >94.
> The cookie can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request

## Background
Many companies require support for ``cross-site cookie`` carrying in scenarios such as unified login, Electron and local development. However, Google completely removed the samesite configuration in Chrome version ``94``. To debug and develop, you can only use solutions such as ``proxy``,``Chromium version <91`` or other browsers, which are not very elegant. With the installation of this plugin, you can easily solve this problem. If you find it useful, please give it a star. If you have any questions, please feel free to raise an ``issue``.

## Install
1. Download the ``cookie-extension.zip`` compressed file from the repository. <a href="https://github.com/newJcole/chrome-cross-domain-cookie/raw/main/cookie-extension.zip">download</a>;
2. Open the ``Chrome`` and go to the extensions directory;
3. Open the developer mode in the upper-right corner of the extensions page;
4. Drag the ``cookie-extension.zip`` file into the extensions page (you can also drag the folder directly) to install it successfully;
5. Click the ``Pin`` button in the upper-right corner of the extension icon in the browser URL input box to keep it permanently in the foreground;
